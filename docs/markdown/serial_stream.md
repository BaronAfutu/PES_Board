# SerialStream

The **SerialStream** class provides a simple interface for transmitting floating-point data from the microcontroller to a host computer (MATLAB or Python) via UART serial communication. It enables real-time data streaming for analysis and visualization. The class supports transmitting up to 30 floating-point values per transmission with a simple synchronization protocol.

This guide provides an overview of the SerialStream functionality, including microcontroller implementation, MATLAB integration, and Python analysis tools.

## Basic Functionality

The `SerialStream` system consists of three components:

### Microcontroller Side (`SerialStream` C++ class):
- Simple buffer for floating-point data (up to 30 float values)
- Transmits data packets via UART at 2 Mbaud
- Implements optional start-byte synchronization protocol
- Automatically sends number of floats once when streaming starts
- Non-buffering, immediate transmission when `send()` is called

### MATLAB Side (`SerialStream.m` class):
- Receives serial data from the microcontroller
- Handles start-byte synchronization
- Collects data and structures it for analysis
- Includes timeout handling and data validation

### Python Side (`SerialStream.py` class):
- Same functionality as MATLAB, but implemented in Python

## Hardware and Pin Configuration

To use the `SerialStream` class, you need an additional Serial to USB cable:

- USB Serial TTL cable

`SerialStream` uses UART communication with the following pin configuration:

```cpp
// Unused UART3
#define PB_UNUSED_UART_TX PB_10
#define PB_UNUSED_UART_RX PC_5
```

- **TX** from the USB Serial TTL cable should be connected to **PB_UNUSED_UART_RX** / **PB_10**.
- **RX** from the USB Serial TTL cable should be connected to **PB_UNUSED_UART_TX** / **PC_5**.
- Make sure to also connect the ground pin of the USB Serial TTL cable to a ground pin of the PES board.

### Communication Protocol

`SerialStream` implements a simple protocol:
1. Host sends start byte (255) to trigger data transmission
2. Microcontroller responds by sending number of floats (once)
3. Microcontroller sends float data when `send()` is called
4. Host collects and processes the received data

## Example Usage

### How to use Serial Stream

Include the `SerialStream` header file in your `main.cpp`:

```cpp
#include "SerialStream.h"
```

Create a `SerialStream` object alongside a `Timer` to measure time.

```cpp
// serial stream to send data over uart
SerialStream serialStream(PB_UNUSED_UART_TX /*PB_10*/,
                          PB_UNUSED_UART_RX /*PC_5 */);

// additional timer to measure time elapsed since last call
Timer logging_timer;
logging_timer.start();
microseconds time_previous_us{0};
```

Measure Delta Time:

```cpp
// measure delta time
const microseconds time_us = logging_timer.elapsed_time();
const float dtime_us = duration_cast<microseconds>(time_us - time_previous_us).count();
time_previous_us = time_us;
```

And send the data to the host computer:

```cpp
if (serialStream.startByteReceived()) {
    // send data over serial stream
    serialStream.write( dtime_us ); //  0 delta time in us
    serialStream.write((float)(1)); //  1 cast 1 to float and log 1.0f
    serialStream.send();
}
```

**Note: The start byte functionality is optional. On the microcontroller side, you can decide whether to use it or not. Its purpose is to trigger the data stream on the microcontroller from the host computer. Everytime you start the data stream from the host computer, either MATLAB or Python, the host computer sends the start byte (255) to the microcontroller. Only then ``startByteReceived()`` returns true, and the microcontroller starts sending data. If you do not want to use the start byte functionality, you can remove the ``if (serialStream.startByteReceived())`` condition and call ``serialStream.send()`` directly. If you intend to use it without the start byte you have to make sure that the host computer is already waiting for the data stream.**

The maximum used throughput in a real application was sending 30 float values at 1 kHz.

**Important Note: Serial Stream relies on you sending delta time values in microseconds as the first signal. This is crucial for the correct functioning of the Serial Stream implementation on the host computer.**

### Key Methods

```cpp
void write(const float val); // write a float value to the internal buffer
void send();                 // send the buffered data to the host
bool startByteReceived();    // check if the host computer has sent the start byte
void reset();                // reset the SerialStream state and clear buffer
```
